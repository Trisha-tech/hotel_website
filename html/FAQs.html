            </p>
            <p class="z2">1. How do I get a receipt? </p>
            If you wish to get a receipt, please use Agoda's self-service option. The self-service option allows you to
            get your receipt under your company name and address. You can also make this request by signing in to 'My
            bookings' via the website. Please note that we only offer an electronic receipt in PDF format.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p class="z2">2. When will I get my refund? </p>
            <p class="z3"> Refunds, if applicable, will immediately be submitted to our bank. From the submission/refund
                date, banks may take up to 30 days to refund this amount, or until your next billing cycle. The refund
                should be converted to your local currency by your credit card company. How your reservation is
                processed will determine what shows on your card statement. However, your statement will ALWAYS show
                "Agoda" somewhere in the subject line.
                <br>
                In some countries, the AgodaCash is offered as a refund and can be credited to your account
                instantaneously.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p class="z2">3. I don’t have a credit card. Can I pay by another method? </p>
            <p class="z3">Yes! Agoda offers travelers multiple convenient ways to pay, including PayPal, debit card,
                bank transfer, online bank transfer, or even ATM and local counter payments in some countries. Many of
                our hotels, villas, and apartments even let you pay in person upon check-in. These payment methods are
                subject to availability and will appear as options on your booking form
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p class="z2">4. Can I pay cash at the property for my reservation? </p>
            <p class="z3">Agoda currently only accepts credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, AMEX, JCB, IDEAL, and Carte
                Bleue) and PayPal.
                1) Rate per room per night - Pay online: If a room is available and you've submitted your credit card
                details and agreed to the booking conditions on the booking form, the reservation is then confirmed and
                a booking confirmation will be automatically sent to your e-mail address. This confirmation is only
                issued after we have verified and charged your credit card. The booking confirmation AND credit card
                must be presented upon check-in, together with a valid form of photo ID.
                <br>
                2) Book Now, Pay Later - Pay online: Book Now, Pay Later is just that - make a booking now, pay for it
                later. The booking will be instantly confirmed. The booking conditions (cancellation policy) will
                determine when you are billed. The actual charge date will be approximately 2-3 days prior to the
                property's booking conditions becoming active. At that time, you will be charged the full amount. This
                option is only available for Visa, MasterCard, AMEX, and JCB. Please make sure you select "Pay Later"
                when you input your credit card details.
                <br>
                3) Special Rates - Pay at the hotel: Agoda works in partnership with other companies to ensure we offer
                the best rates. If you choose to stay at a hotel where an Agoda partner has provided the lowest rate, we
                will confirm your reservation and issue a confirmation email. In such cases, we will not charge your
                card. You will be required to pay the hotel directly upon check-out and the hotel's own cancellation
                policy will apply. The title of the rate section for these hotels is 'Special rates' instead of 'Rate
                per room per night'.
                <br>
                Please note: The property reserves the right to preauthorize/charge your credit card prior to arrival.
                Timing and amount of charges will be in line with the conditions of your booking.

            <p class="z2">1. When do I get a confirmation email? </p>
            <p class="z3"> In most cases, you will receive this email along with the booking voucher (PDF file) within
                30 minutes of booking. If you still haven't received it after that time, please check your junk mail
                and/or spam filters. You can always view your booking status online by signing in and selecting "My
                bookings" from the account menu.

            <p class="z2">2. How do I know if my reservation is confirmed? </p>

                file) within 30 minutes of you making the booking. The booking voucher indicates that you have a
                confirmed booking with Agoda. Should you not receive it after this time, please check your junk mail
                and/or spam filters. You can also check your booking status by signing in to "My bookings" via the
                website.

                booking via self-service, the cancellation policy will be shown again upon cancellation. Note: Details
                and conditions in the cancellation policy will be different for each booking depending on the property,
                period of stay, room type, etc. Please read this carefully before submitting your booking.

            <p class="z2"> 1. How can I review a hotel?</p>
            <p class="z3"> In order to ensure that all reviews are legitimate, only customers with a valid completed
                booking are allowed to submit a hotel review. After completing your stay, you should receive an email
                with a link to a review submission page for that stay. This page is also accessible through your Agoda
                account page; the review section has a list of properties you’ve stayed at and which are available to
                review.

            <hr>
            <p class="z2">2. Why isn't my Agoda Verified Review posted on your website?</p>
            <p class="z3"> Agoda Verified Reviews are screened by editors before being posted to our website to make
                sure the content complies with our review guidelines, available here. We work hard to approve reviews
                and get them onto the site as quickly as possible.
