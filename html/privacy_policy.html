            <h1> Privacy Policy</h1>
        </div><br>

        <div class="note">
            <h3> Introduction</h3>

            This Privacy Policy describes how collects, uses, and shares information about you when you visit and
            interact on our website (mobile and desktop) or other means connected to the Sites (such as contacting our
            customer service team via chat or email). Below is a summary of our privacy practices. Our full Privacy
            Policy is available below.
            <br> <br>
            <p class="p1"> 1. Information We Collect</p>
            We collect information about you that you provide to us when using the Site, such as your name, address,
            phone number, credit card details, e-mail address, accommodation name, accommodation location and/or length
            of stay, and your account password for accommodation reservations.
            <br>
            By visiting our Site, we may also automatically collect certain usage information, such as your IP address,
            geographic data, country, search preferences related to specific searches, browser, and information about
            your device's operating system, application version, language settings, and pages that have been shown to
            you. If you are using a mobile device to access our mobile app or mobile optimized Site, we might also
            collect information that identifies your mobile device, such as the device ID, location of the device (with
            your consent), and device-specific settings and characteristics.
            <br>
            If you need to get in touch with our customer support team, or reach out to us through other means (such as
            through social media, or communicating with your accommodation through us), we will collect information from
            you there too.
            <br>
            Where you submit reviews regarding your accommodation or other ancillary services available on our website
            through us, we will collect information from you included in your reviews, including your first name and
            country of residence.
            <br>
            You can decide to participate in our referral programs or other promotions, and doing this will also mean
            providing us with personal data. In addition to that, you can provide us with feedback or ask for help with
            using the Sites or our various communications platforms.
            <br>
            Accommodation partners may share information about you with us too – this may happen if you have questions
            about your pending booking or if disputes arise regarding your booking.
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="p1"> 2. How We Use the Information We Collect</p>
            We may use information collected through the Site to:<br>
            <ul>
                <li> Provide you with the requested services, such as creating a user account, processing and confirming
                    your reservation, and communicating with you about services requested (e.g., pre-reservation or post
                    booking chat support (excluding credit card number), special request, cancellations, rewards
                </li>
                <li>
                    Send you email marketing communications about products and services that may be relevant to you
                </li>
                <li> Conduct surveys or provide you with information about our services on our Site or on other websites
                    you may visit
                </li>
                <li> Maintain and improve the Site, tailor the user experience, and for internal training
                </li>
                <li> Protect the security of you and the Site
                </li>
                <li> Exercising a right or obligation conferred or imposed by law, including responding to request and
                    legal demands
                </li>
            </ul> <br>
            When you make a reservation on one of our business partners’ websites or apps, we may also receive certain
            information such as your name and reservation information, including the accommodation reserved, in order to
            process your reservation and identify which channel your reservation has originated from.
            <br> <br> During calls with our customer support team, live listening may be done or calls may be recorded
            for quality and reference purposes which includes the usage of the recordings for the handling of claims,
            training and fraud detection purposes. If you would prefer that your call was not recorded, you can opt out
            by stating this, or by hanging up. Call recordings are kept for a limited amount of time and automatically
            deleted thereafter, unless Agoda has a legitimate interest to keep such recording for a longer period,
            including for fraud investigation and legal purposes.
            <br><br> Please note that the confirmation emails and text messages sent after your booking, as well as the
            guest review emails sent after your departure, are not marketing messages. These messages are part of your
            accommodation reservation process. Respectively, they contain information for you to check in at your booked
            accommodation, and tools to optionally rate that accommodation after your stay. You will continue to receive
            them, even if you have opted out of our marketing messages. Similarly, opting into receiving Price Alerts
            will not affect any other choices you have made regarding receiving communications from us. If you elect to
            receive Price Alerts, you will be able to opt out of receiving the same by clicking on the “turn off price
            alerts” or a similar message found in the Price Alert sent to you.
            <br> <br>
            <p class="p1"> 3. Mobile Devices</p>
            With your consent, we may send you push notifications with information about your reservation, potential
            future stays, or as part of any programs that you participate in, including coupons. You may grant us access
            to your location information or contact details in order to provide services requested by you. When you
            upload a picture from your mobile device, your picture may also be tagged with your location information.
            Please read the instructions of your mobile device to understand how to change the settings and enable the
            sharing of such information or the receipt of (or opt out of receiving) push notifications (including
            Software Development Kit ("SDK") and push token data). Different device operating systems may have different
            default settings, so please familiarize yourself with such settings governing push notifications.
            <br> <br>
            <p class="p1"> 4. Sharing Your Information</p>
            In connection with your visit to our Site and use of our services, we may share your information as follows:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong> Travel Suppliers</strong> such as accommodation properties (e.g., the specific
                    accommodation that you have requested us to reserve) and/or third party accommodation suppliers
                    (e.g., Booking.com), airline, car rental, insurance, and, where available, activity providers, who
                    fulfil your travel reservations. These suppliers may contact you as necessary to obtain additional
                    information about you, facilitate your travel reservation including communicating with you prior to
                    arrival about your upcoming stay, or respond to a review you may submit in accordance with their own
                    independent privacy policies.
                </li>
                <li> <strong>Third Party Service Providers</strong> who provide data processing services to us (for
                    example web hosting), or who otherwise process personal information for purposes such as credit card
                    and payment processing, business analytics, customer service, marketing, or distribution of surveys,
                    to facilitate the delivery of online services and advertising tailored to your interests, and/or
                    fraud prevention. Our third party service providers will only process information as needed to
                    perform their functions. They are not permitted to share or use the information for any other
                    purpose.
                </li>
                <li> <strong>Business Partners</strong> with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose
                    products or services may be offered on our Sites. You can tell when a third-party business partner
                    is involved in a product or service you have requested because their name will appear, either alone
                    or with ours. If you choose to access these optional services, we will on occasion share your
                    personal information with those partners. An example of a business partner would be a third-party
                    loyalty program that you will earn points for, through a booking.
                </li>
                <li> <strong>Our Affiliated Group Companies -</strong> our affiliated (group) companies' employees who

                    (audit/compliance) investigations.

                    information to enforce or apply the terms and conditions applicable to our services or to protect
                    the rights, property, or safety of our users, or others.
                </li>
                <li> <strong>Business Reorganization - </strong>such as part of any sale, assignment or other transfer

                </li>
            </ul>
            We provide appropriate protections for such sharing as required by applicable law to prohibit third parties

            application program interfaces ("APIs"), and other technologies (collectively, "Cookies") on our Site that
            collect and store certain information about you. Some of these Cookies are necessary to provide, secure, and
            maintain the Site to you, such as to keep you logged in while your visit our Site, while other Cookies are

            <br> <br>
            <ul>
                <li> To personalize the Site by remembering information about your activities on the Site (e.g., the
                    language you selected or your log-in details). We may also use Cookies together with other
                    automatically collected usage information to recognize a user across different devices, sessions or
                    browsers (including when they have not logged-in) so as to deliver tailored information;
                </li>
                <li> Perform website analytics, such as impression reporting, demographic reporting and interest
                    reporting. This may include the recording of mouse clicks, movements, page scrolling and restricted
                    text entered into our Site forms through selected third parties but we will take sufficient
                    precautions to ensure that personal information will not be collected during such recordings e.g.
                    through the adoption of irreversible masking. Website analytics is used to improve our Site and
                    services; and
                </li>
                <li> To provided you advertising tailored to your interest (see below for details)

            </ul>
            We may also allow certain third parties to place Cookies on our Site in order to collect information about
            your online activities on our Site (e.g., pages visited on the Site and searches you performed) and over
            time and across different websites you may visit. This information is used to provide advertising tailored
            to your interests from us (via email, on our Site, and on other websites) and by third parties on other
            websites you may visit, also known as interest based advertising, and to analyze the effectiveness of such
            interest based advertising. We may also share one-way hashed information with third party partners (e.g.,

            on other websites or mobile apps based on your prior visits to the Site. It neither supports nor endorses
            the goals, causes, or statements of any websites or mobile apps that display our advertisements.
            <br> <br>
            <strong> Cross-Device Tracking</strong>
            <br> We may also combine information collected through Cookies and certain usage information from a
            particular browser or mobile device with another computer or device that may be linked to you (cross-device
            tracking) in order to optimize our services and provide tailored communications and advertisements to you.
            If you do not want it to combine such information for its optimization of communications to you please
            unsubscribe from the communications i.e. the newsletter.
            <br><br> <strong> Your Choices</strong>
            <br> Please review your Internet browser settings, typically under the sections "Help" or "Internet
            Options," to exercise choices you have for certain Cookies. If you disable or delete certain Cookies in your
            Internet browser settings, you might not be able to access or use important functions or features of this
            Site, and you may be required to re-enter your log-in details.
            <br> To learn more about certain Cookies used for interest based advertising (including through cross-device
            tracking) and to exercise certain opt-out choices you may have regarding Cookies, please visit the Digital
            Advertising Alliance, Network Advertising Initiative, Digital Advertising Alliance-Canada, European
            Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance or for our mobile app, by updating your device settings or
            downloading the AppChoices app.

            <br> <br> Please also visit the following third parties' websites to exercise certain opt-out choices over
            Cookies:
            <br> <br> Google Analytics - https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
            <br> Appsflyer (mobile app analytics) - By emailing appsflyer at: privacy@appsflyer.com
            <br> Baidu - http://www.baidu.com/duty/safe_control.html
            <br> Apple - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074
            <br> Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/ads/settings

            <br> Mouseflow recording - https://mouseflow.com/opt-out/
            <br> SecuredTouch - https://www.securedtouch.com/privacy/
            <br> <br> By exercising such choice regarding interest based advertising, you may still receive
            advertisements, but the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your
            interests. You should also know that logging out of your user account will not actually mean that you opt
            out of personalized advertisements.
            <br> <br> You may need to make such choices on each browser and device you may use to exercise choice
            regarding certain Cookies. Lastly, at this time the Site is not configured to honor browsers' "Do Not Track"
            signals, except where required by applicable law.
            <br> <br>
            <p class="p1"> 6. Opting Out of Marketing Communications from Us</p>
            You can opt out of receiving marketing communications from us at any time by using the "Unsubscribe" link in
            each newsletter or communication, or through your account (if you've created one) - the email subscriptions

            <br> <br>
            <p class="p1"> 7. Information from Other Partners</p>
            On occasion, affiliated entities, business partners, or other third party providers may share information
            with us. One example is if you access or sign in to our Site through social media, such as Facebook Connect,
            we may collect information from you such as your username, and other information made available to us via
            such services. In general, your ability to provide such information is through the service provider
            themselves and you can change those settings in your account settings of the relevant service provider. In
            general, we may work with our partners to improve and personalize your use of our website in accordance with
            this policy.
            <br> <br> We have partnered with Facebook to provide personalized content on it for members of Facebook. If
            you are a Facebook user and you have signed into it via the Facebook single sign on feature, then our Site
            will be personalized for you to display information/stays of your Facebook friends at accommodation in the
            past and also future stays at accommodation bookable through the Site. The information that may be displayed
            include the name of the accommodation, the date of stay, the location of the accommodation, your review of
            past accommodation, the hotel room and price of the hotel room ("Stay Information"), and such information
            may be shown and personalized to you on the search pages of the accommodation on the Site, and the search
            calendar amongst other places. Further, your Stay Information will also be displayed to your Facebook
            friends who are also customers and who have signed in through the Facebook single sign on feature on the
            Site, as displayed on their search pages described above within the Site and updated each time you make a
            booking through it.
            <br> <br> How to opt out: It has made it simple for you to opt out of this feature at any time by toggling
            "no" through (i) the thank you page after you make a booking, and (ii) your "Manage My Booking" page on the
            Site. Further, if you need help to opt out you may contact our customer experience team at any time.
            <br> <br>
            <p class="p1"> 8. Protecting Your Information</p>
            We maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and organizational security measures to protect your
            information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, or unauthorized
            disclosure or access. We use Secure Socket Layer technology to encrypt credit card information during
            transit. Through your personal account, you also have the ability to save credit card details for faster
            future bookings and payments. Your card details are encrypted and you can always log in to your personal
            account to delete, edit, or add certain credit card details. For security reasons, the number cannot be
            edited (but the card details can be deleted). When viewing card details, only the last 4 digits of the
            number will be visible. Please note that we will store the last 4 digits of your credit card securely upon
            any booking made (this is required to manage any refund requests for that booking).
            <br> <br> Data Retention
            <br> We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this
            Privacy Policy and internal company policies. When it no longer needs to use your information, we will –
            unless we need to keep your information to comply with applicable legal or regulatory obligations or the
            information is required to carry out corporate tasks and achieve our business objectives – remove it from
            our systems and records and/or take steps to properly anonymize it so that you can no longer be identified
            from it.
            <br> <br>
